# Logical brain. Low-level heart. Always curious.

Currently building a portfolio in **offensive security**, with a strong focus on:
- **Reverse engineering**
- **Binary exploitation**
- **Application security**

Background in C, Java and Python — with a preference for **low-level logic**, clean code and efficiency over trends. 

Fast learner with an atypical cognitive profile. I dive deep, I build fast and I don’t stop until it works — and works well. 

This GitHub is where I publish:
- Personal tools and scripts (some with pro/free split)
- Mini-projects in C and Python
- Learning logs and writeups

Also active on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) — Jr Pentester path ~65% complete.

If you’re looking for a profile who:
- Builds fast and learns faster
- Enjoys finding the edge cases and odd behaviours
- Doesn’t fake understanding — and doesn’t pretend to fit in either

→ You’re in the right place.
